## An introduction to User Centered Design

The basic process of user centered design involves four phases:

* Analyze: talk to users and discover their needs
* Ideate: brainstorm solutions
* Build: create a prototype (which may be low fidelity)
* Test: test your assumptions about the prototype by observing real users.

(repeat)

The key is to focus on iteration: or creating small testable prototypes, testing, and incorporating feedback and lessons learned into an improved prototype.
