All this is changing because people don&#39;t have access to printers and scanners right now. Instead, they are forced to use e-signatures - and discover by accident all the inefficiencies of the last 20 years... <a href="https://t.co/YRiqujrS7C">pic.twitter.com/YRiqujrS7C</a></p>&mdash; Jack Shepherd (@jackwshepherd) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackwshepherd/status/1255811639322054656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  rely on HotDocs
