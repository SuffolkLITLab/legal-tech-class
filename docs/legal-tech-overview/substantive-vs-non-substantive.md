## Substantive vs. Non-Substantive applications

We can distinguish between _substantive_ apps that replace a traditional
legal advice role, from non-substantive apps that simply make the job of a
litigant or lawyer simpler.

Substantive apps:
* Gather facts from the user
* Provide information that is tailored to the user's situation
* May provide final documents that are similarly tailored to the user's
  situation

In short, they act a lot like a lawyer who meets with a client. And users often
treat these apps like lawyers.

Substantive apps include:
* Expert systems
* Form and template filling applications
