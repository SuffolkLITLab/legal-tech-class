## Before you get started

We will discuss the first few sections of this assignment in class. To refresh
your memory and reflect on your own, I recommend skimming the [Overview of
Docassemble](introduction-to-docassemble.md), Description of [YAML](yaml.md), and the section
describing [Mako](mako.md). If you run into any trouble, please ask for help on
the A2J Slack channel.

Watch the video below to learn how to create an account on our Docassemble server and
on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

## What is Docassemble?

Docassemble is a system for running interactive questionnaires. It uses several
open source technologies, including Python, Markdown, YAML and docx-template to
let you concentrate on writing your interviews and writing very little code.
Yet, it's flexible enough to allow you to use advanced coding techniques when
you need to do so.

## Introduction to the Docassemble Playground

We will use the Docassemble playground for all exercises. Log in to your
Docassemble server. When you are loggged in, click on your email address, and
then select the Playground option to reach the Playground.

<img alt="Overview of the Docassemble Playground" src={useBaseUrl('img/playground_window.png')} />

The Playground is made up of several elements.

1. The main text editing window
1. A list of example blocks that can be directly inserted into the text editing window
1. A list of variables and functions available in the current interview file
1. The save and run button, used to run the interview and view results.
1. The share button which also gives you a link that can be shared 

## Hello, World

In computer programming, the [traditional first
exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) in a new
programming language is to display the text "Hello, World."

### Baby steps

Let's erase the text in the playground and replace it with the text below:

```yaml
question: Hello, World
```

Docassemble interviews contain a series of `specifiers` followed by text, such
as the `question` specifier. The `question` specifier tells docassemble that
what follows will be the title of a screen displayed to the user.

When you save and then run this sample, you will notice an error.

```
Error
Docassemble has finished executing all code blocks marked as initial or mandatory, and finished asking all questions marked as mandatory (if any). It is a best practice to end your interview with a question that says goodbye and offers an Exit button.
```

### The mandatory specifier
Take a minute to read the error message. In Docassemble, your interview can
contain many questions and branches that are never shown to the user. This error
is telling us that _none_ of the questions are marked as `mandatory`, or
required, so Docassemble doesn't know what to display. Let's fix that.

```yaml
question: Hello, World
mandatory: True
```

The `mandatory` specifier marks this block as required. Now when we run the
interview, we'll see the text "Hello, World" on the screen without any errors.

> **Note**: you should normally have only ONE `mandatory` block in a single
> interview. We'll discuss good practices around this later.

### Introducing variables

The purpose of Docassemble is to gather information from the users. Let's ask
the user's name so we can greet them personally.

```yaml
question: Hello, ${user_name}
mandatory: True
---
question: What is your name?
fields:
  - Name: user_name
```

We introduced several new ideas in this interview. Notice that each screen in
the interview is separated by three dashes, like this: `---`.

We introduced a new `specifier`, `fields`. Instead of single line of text, this
`specifier` takes a list. Each field in the list is indented and begins with a
single dash, like this: `-`. Each item has a label, followed by a colon,
followed by the name of the variable that the user's input will be assigned to.

To learn more about the format of a Docassemble interview, read the section on
the [YAML format](yaml.md).

We also introduced `variables`. A variable is simply a placeholder. `user_name`
is a variable that is a placeholder for the user's name. Inside the Docassemble
interview, we can display a variable by surrounding it with `Mako` tags, like
this: `${variable_name}`.

> **Note**: We don't need to tell Docassemble to mark the second question as
> mandatory. Because the mandatory question requires the variable `user_name`,
> Docassemble automatically asks the first question that provides a definition.

### Introducing logic

Sometimes you want to answer a question with some logic rather than directly
asking the user for information.

Docassemble uses [Python](python.md), a powerful but easy to read programming
language to control logic inside an interview. Python statements go inside a
`code` block.

```yaml
---
code: |
  # This is a comment. notice that we assign a value with =, and we test a value with ==
  if user_name == "Scotty":
    secret_message = "Beam Me Up, Scotty"
  else:
    secret_message = "No message to report."
---    
question: |
  Hello, ${user_name}
subquestion: |
  ${secret_message}
mandatory: True
---
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - Name: user_name
```

In the example above, we introduced the use of the `|` line continuation marker,
or vertical pipe. We always use this when the text that follows could go on
multiple lines, and to handle special characters (like accented letters). You
also always use it for a `code` block.

We also introduced the `subquestion` specifier. `subquestion` is used for longer
explanation text on a screen. It uses a smaller font that is not bold.

Sometimes you don't want to use logic to create a new variable. You can use
simple Python code right inside a `question` or `subquestion` block, although the
syntax is very slightly different.

```yaml
---  
question: Hello, ${user_name}
subquestion: |
  % if user_name == 'Spock':
  Live long and prosper.
  % endif
mandatory: True
---
question: What is your name?
fields:
  - Name: user_name
```

Notice that inside a `question` block, the line with the `if` statement starts
with `%`. We also need to use an `endif` statement, instead of using indentation
to show the beginning and end of the `if` statement.

> **Note**:  [YAML](yaml.md) is picky about indentation. If you run into an
> error, check to make sure each line is indented the same way as the example
> above.

## Your assignment

1. Modify the Hello, World exercise so that it ask for the user's first and last
   names separately.

## Working with GitHub

One of the powerful features of Docassemble is its integration with
[GitHub](https://github.com). GitHub is like track changes on steroids. It helps
people work in teams and to let an individual keep track of the history of a
project, which is important for solving bugs.

The DocAssembly Line use GitHub.

Watch this video again to learn how to create a GitHub account.

For our exercise today, we'll work with this
[repository](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-teachingtuesday).

In the Playground, visit the Packages folder.

<img alt="Packages Menu" src={useBaseUrl('img/folders_packages.png')} />

Pull the repository into the playground.

<img alt="Pull Package" src={useBaseUrl('img/Playground_Pull.png')} />

Click back. Switch to the file `plain_language_experiment.yml`. Edit the text in
the Playground, following the instructions that are right in the file.

Go back to the Packages menu. Now, you can click the Github button to add your
changes back on the repository. Make your changes in a **new branch**. Add your
github username to the branch name. Branch names can include hyphens, but not
spaces.

<img alt="Pull Package" src={useBaseUrl('img/github_new_branch.png')} />

Add a brief "commit message". A commit message is a short note that explains
what you changed since the last time you sent code to GitHub in this repository.

Click the "Commit" button to send your changes to GitHub.
