## Meeting Time
LAW-2156-AD

Tuesdays 02:00PM - 03:50PM, Sargent Hall, Room 305

This course makes extensive use of Microsoft Teams, and does not use the
Canvas online course management system. You will be invited to join
the Microsoft Team. Teams will be used for turning in assignments and
viewing grades and rubrics.

In the event of bad weather, we may have class over Zoom, but the default
will be in-person attendance.

## Course overview

Becoming familiar with legal technology as a consumer, author, 
or project manager is a competitive advantage in today's legal market. 
Lawyers today use technology to:

* Run the business side of the law firm, including
    * Tracking client information
    * Reaching new clients
* Help make decisions
* Reduce repetitive tasks through automation and templates
* Deliver legal services directly to consumers

Legal Tech for Small Firm Practice is a survey-style seminar that
aims to introduce you to the use of legal technology in the practice of law. We
will focus closely on the access to justice problem and the needs of people
who cannot afford to hire attorneys.

50% of your grade will be based on a final project that incorporates legal technology.
Most students will create a simple "app" that solves a legal problem using the tools and processes
of the [Document Assembly Line](https://github.com/suffolklitlab/docassemble-AssemblyLine). You
may also choose a different technology to develop your final project.
**You do not need any prior coding background or experience** to earn an "A" in this class.

About half of our in-class time will be spent on discussions and exercises that get you
thinking about legal technology, and about half will be hands-on training with a representative
sample of legal technology tools. We will spend special attention to the free and open source
[Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) application.

We will have frequent guest speakers and readings that address different aspects of legal
technology and law.

### Course materials

There are no required textbooks for this class. All readings will be available online for free.

### Course Goals & Learning Objectives

| GOALS | OBJECTIVES | ASSESSMENTS |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Gain familiarity with technologies used by lawyers for legal work | Identify and categorize different types of legal technology, comparing the benefits and drawbacks of each tool in various scenarios | In-class discussion, presentations |
| Recognize ethical and regulatory challenges presented by legal technology | Describe the current regulatory landscape, delineate challenges posed by ethical rules regarding legal technology, and discuss potential moral considerations in automation decisions | In-class discussion |
| Decompose processes into component parts analytically | Map specific processes, pinpointing inefficiencies and proposing potential improvements | Demonstrated through project work |
| Develop a software application tailored to legal tasks | Define a legal technology need, collaborate with clients to outline a project scope, formulate software requirements, and automate a chosen process from initiation to completion | Final project; interim assignments |
| Segment legal rules or knowledge into automatable units | Break down a legal rule or knowledge into discrete, automatable segments using diagrams and software tools | Assessments and in-class discussions |
| Explore career trajectories for tech-savvy lawyers | Enumerate and discuss the diverse roles of technology in legal practice and how technical acumen can augment various job roles | In-class discussion |


### Grading

There is no forced curve in this class. Grading of your final project is holistic, 
focused on your growth and ability to apply the skills we learn in class.

I try to assign final grades based on natural cutoffs in the distribution
of student work across assignments. Typically, an "A" grade is equivalent to a 
cumulative grade of 92 or above.

#### Graded assignments

Your final grade will be based on the following work:

Component                  | Percent
---------------------------|----------------------
Legal tech assessment      | 10% (opportunity for extra credit)
Weekly reading and journal entries     | 10% (pass/fail)
Plain language exercise    | 10%
Free tool fiesta           | 10%
Clio University modules    | 5%
App "teardown"             | 10%
Final project outline      | 10% (pass/fail)
Final project presentation | 5%
Final project              | 40%

My goal is to give you a chance to demonstrate your mastery of the
material in multiple ways over the course of the semester and to avoid
a single high stakes assessment. You will have an opportunity for frequent
feedback and advice on your final project.

#### Class participation not graded

Class works best when everyone is an active participant.
However, research shows that using class participation as the basis for grading
is often [arbitrary and unfair](https://www.edutopia.org/article/class-participation-too-arbitrary-grade-fairly).
Therefore, class participation will not factor into your final grade.

### Philosophy

The philosophy of this course is that by becoming familiar with legal technology
and using it to solve real problems, you will be able to become a better
critic, regulator, purchaser, and consumer of legal products as a practicing attorney. I do
not expect you to become expert software developers. You should learn "just enough"
to be useful in your future work.

I will do my best to provide you opportunities for growth in this class, and I expect
you to come into the class with a "growth mindset".

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1CHPnZfFmU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The process of computer programming often
involves repeatedly running into errors. Errors are an opportunity to learn. In
addition, creating a successful product requires iteration. The first draft is
often the first chance to do real discovery about what works and what does not
work.

As new coders, you will need to ask a lot of questions. I will never "hide the
ball" or refuse to answer direct questions. Questions are part of the learning
process, especially for new coders. Failing to ask questions may frustrate and
slow you down.

:::info Rule of thumb
If you are stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, ask for help! Use Teams,
ask a friend, or send me an email. Chances are there will be a more interesting
problem to solve after we get past your "blocker".
:::

Software development is a highly results-oriented domain. It is not just okay,
but expected to use libraries, prewritten code, and samples to reduce
reinvention of basic components of your product. I expect each student to
produce unique work, but not to waste time rewriting code that already works to
achieve a goal.

Being successful in this class means:

* Asking for help and feedback early. You will not be graded negatively if you
  don't understand everything right away. It's expected to need to ask many
  questions early on.
* Accepting that you will run into errors and perhaps dead ends
* Your first draft will look very different from your final product
* It is not just okay, but an important part of the process to collaborate,
  share early drafts, and gather feedback.

Software development is a creative endeavor that can be truly exhilarating.
There is the struggle of creation and then the excitement and joy of producing
something that can live on in the world. Most of all, it should be fun.

## Policies

### Assignment due date flexibility

I have arranged a schedule of assignments that paces the work over the full semester. But
I understand that it may not account for work in your other courses or life responsibilities.

If the deadline for any assignment does not work for you for any reason, I am embracing a
flexible deadline approach to this course. Work may be turned in on an alternate schedule without
any grade penalty. To use this flexibility:

1. Propose a new deadline for the assignment. I will let you know if the new deadline works. (Up to 1 week will normally be automatic).
1. Understand that it may take me longer (at times substantially longer) to review
   work that is not turned in on the regular schedule, which may delay your grade and feedback on the assignment.

### Accommodations
If you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course
due to the impact of a disability, it is important that you contact the Law
School's Dean of Student Office for further information and assistance,
including information on disability-related accommodations. We can then plan how
best to coordinate any accommodations. 

### Attendance Policy

Observe Suffolk Law School's [general attendance policy](https://www.suffolk.edu/law/academics-clinics/student-life/policies-rules/academic-rules-regulations?scrollTo=id2B#collapse-Rule-2-Academic-Standards). All work can be turned
in electronically through Teams. In the event that the
University cancels classes, such as for severe weather, you are expected to
continue with assignments as originally scheduled unless otherwise communicated
through email.

As of this writing, missing more than 2 classes may require a meeting and 
permission from the dean to allow you to remain in the course.

### Course Schedule
The schedule, policies, procedures, and assignments are subject to change
in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, or to ensure
better student learning.  This course is a work in progress, and I'm always
looking for ways to improve.  Therefore, mid-course corrections should be
anticipated! This online version will be the most "up to date," so if you print
this, just be aware that the "official" version will be the digital version
available at this web page.

### Policy on use of generative AI and large language models (e.g., ChatGPT)

#### What are generative AI tools?

The line is getting fuzzier by the day, but in general, any tool with which you provide
a prompt and get back new or substantially revised text is one I would describe
as generative AI. These tools all have a creative function that distinguishes them
from tools that simply correct your work.

Examples of "generative AI" tools:

* ChatGPT
* Bing Chat
* Google Bard
* Google Docs's "Help me Write" feature

Examples of tools that are not "generative AI":

* Spellcheck and grammar check
* Microsoft's "Editor" tool
* Grammarly
* WordRake

#### Why we provide guidance on use of generative AI

1. To ensure substantive accuracy of output;
1. To help you understand how to avoid violation of client confidentiality and privacy;
1. To help you build competency in the use of these tools and to be able to produce your own work in instances where the tools will fail;
1. To provide transparency into your authorship so that I can appropriately assess your work.

#### Limits on use of AI

You may use generative AI tools on all assignments in this course.
Where possible, I will provide instruction on how to appropriately use AI on a given assignment.

You should also always follow these general rules:

1. Don't substitute the AI's judgment for your own. When I ask you to reflect, synthesize, or argue, I am asking for your thoughts, not those of the AI. You may use the AI as an "editor." For example: you can ask it if your reflection is missing anything.
1. Don't put private or confidential information into commercial AI tools. I hope to
provide you access to a Suffolk-owned tool which will be safe to use for this purpose.
1. Follow the "**50% rule**": your original writing combined with any prompt to the tool should reflect at least 50% of the word count of the final content.
1. Check your work for accuracy. Large language models are predictive tools and can make mistakes. Your job is to verify your work.
1. Let me know how you used each tool. I'll occasionally ask you to provide a log
of your conversation with an AI tool, but you should always use attribution.

- May 3, 2024: Final projects due at 5 PM
- May 10, 2024: Last day of final exams (last day of any extensions/makeup work)

## Final project (Due May 3rd)

### Overview
This project involves identifying a real-world problem related to either access to justice or challenges faced by small law firms and developing a technological solution to address it. 

The tool's audience is up to you. For example: it might be entirely internal to a law firm, or focused at unsophisticated members of the 
general public.

You are highly encouraged to create a project that both:

1. Makes use of paper prototypes or flowcharts to map a useful real-world process improvement
1. Incorporates 1 or more working prototype technical solutions using a tool we learned in class

You are not limited to producing a fully working prototype of your solution. And you are not limited to using a single
tool. For example: you could build a knowledgebase in Josef Q and combine it with an intake interview built in Law Droid.

Use the narrative and written sections of your final project to bridge the gap between your vision and your capabilities and available
time. You may also incorporate wireframes or visual elements. However: 
**at least part of your project must involve an interactive element that makes use of the tools we covered in class.**

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Problem Identification and Solution Pitch (Early Deliverable)**: 
   - **Task**: Identify a specific issue in the legal field and propose a process improvement or technological solution.
   - **Deliverables**: A detailed written pitch, including a conceptual "paper prototype" or early design of the proposed solution. This should reflect significant thought and effort, going beyond a general description.

2. **Prototype Creation and expansion on initial pitch**:
   - **Task**: Develop a prototype or a set of prototypes that collectively address the identified problem. Your solution can incorporate elements like intake systems, document automation, or other legal tech tools.
   - **Deliverables**: A comprehensive prototype (or prototypes) with explanations of how each component works and integrates. While a fully functional integrated tool is not required, if the tool is not fully integrated, the submission should include detailed
   flowcharts, narratives, or diagrams explaining the envisioned functionality and integration.

### Grading:
This project constitutes 50% of your course grade, evaluated based on originality, feasibility, depth of analysis, and the quality of the proposed solution and prototypes.

#### 1. Initial Pitch Evaluation Rubric

| Criteria                     | Excellent (A)                                      | Good (B)                                            | Satisfactory (C)                                    | Needs Improvement (D-F)                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

### Submission Deadlines:
- **Part 1 (Pitch):** February 27th
- **Part 2 (Prototype):** May 3rd

This project is an opportunity to apply legal tech concepts to real-world scenarios, demonstrating both your understanding of the course material and your innovative thinking in legal technology.

### What tools can I use?

This semester, we will spend several hours in class working with the open source tool Docassemble and
the LIT 
Lab's [Document Assembly Line project](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/), 
framework. Many students will choose to use this for their final project. You will have the most support
with this tool.

**You are highly encouraged to use 2 or more tools we learn, with the written narrative or diagrams acting as a "glue".**

If you choose a Docassemble form that is appropriate to be hosted on [CourtFormsOnline.org](https://courtformsonline.org),
there is a chance that it will eventually be published (usually at least a semester later). 
You may also choose a Docassemble project that is suggested by a state that the LIT Lab works with, including:

* Alaska
* Illinois
* Louisiana
* Maine
* Massachusetts
* Michigan
* Minnesota
* Texas
* Vermont

You may find a form on the [Form Explorer](https://suffolklitlab.org/form-explorer/) index page. Note: there
is no requirement to automate a "unique" form but many high-interest Massachusetts forms have already been
automated, which may reduce the chance of your work being published. If you are looking forward to your work
being published, it may make sense to choose a form from a different state.

You may also use:

* Gavel
* Pipedream
* Microsoft Forms + Power Automate
* Law Droid
* Josef Q
* Or any other form building or chatbot tool, even if we didn't discuss it in class (with preapproval)

### Examples of past projects

Students are often inspired by a legal process they have been part of or that came up in a law firm they
worked for. Past projects have included:

* divorce
   * intake
   * triage between 1A and 1B
   * pretrial memo
   * simple divorce automation
* restraining orders
   * triage between 209A and 258E
* housing
   * eviction answer
   * motion to stay execution
* estate planning
* intake for a personal injury firm

### How complete should it be?

Think of this as similar to a model bridge that an architecture student might build in class. Your project 
should be considered a useful prototype, not at the same level as a commercial tool. Specifically, it should:

* Run through to the end
* Make good use of plain language, a logical question order and organization
* Be enough to convince a decision maker to invest in making a final, refined version of your tool

An excellent document assembly or intake project will:

* have 10-20 screens and 
* complete a 1-2 page form

An excellent triage project will:

* have 20-30 screens and
* provide structured legal information about 3-5 possible scenarios

**Expect to spend between 30-50 hours on your final project, including research, testing, and planning.**

### What if I can't code?

You will not be expected to know how to code before you join the class. I will teach you the skills that you need.

A large portion of your grade will be based the "soft" skills--selection of the right focus, breaking a rule into logical components, plain language,
and question order and structure.

When (not if) you run into a bug or software challenge, just ask for help! That is part of the learning process,
and asking for help is not just OK but expected to succeed in the class.

You may also select a tool based on the level of coding required. Choosing a tool that requires less coding 
knowledge will not harm your grade. But be sure that you understand the tradeoffs and fit the project to the tool.


### Getting started with your project

#### Identify a topic, a potential audience for the tool, and a goal

In the process of selecting a project, consider:

* Who your audience likely is
* What goal they would have
* How your project can and cannot address their goal
* What work they would need to do independently of your project to complete their goal, both before and after using your app

#### Research

Use your legal research skills to identify the relevant statutes, rules, and context
that your user would need to achieve their goal. 

Now, put your proposed app in the context of the wider goal. Document the information
that you can include in the app to help the user, and the information that you need to provide
both before and after they use your app.

Document the location and sources that supports your work.

#### Draft an output document

Start with the output first. Identify the questions that you need to ask your
user to complete the output of your app.

If you have chosen one or more forms, the output already exists. If you are creating
an intake questionnaire, you may want to start by creating a simple Microsoft Word document
with the information.

#### Write draft questions

Your questions should not be limited to the literal fields on an existing form. They will include:

* Screening questions that decide if the tool is appropriate for the user
* Questions that fill in the blank spaces on the form
* Intermediate questions that help the user answer blank spaces
* Questions that guide the user to correct "next steps"

#### Build a first prototype

If you are working with Docassemble, you can use the [Weaver](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/planning) to build a prototype that can
be refined.

[Flowchart.fun](https://flowchart.fun) can also help you diagram your work.

#### Refine

Your initial prototype will be the first chance for you to run the project through
from start to finish. You will likely realize a lot of things that you want to change.

If you are developing a form in Docassemble, follow the [editing guidelines](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customizing_interview)
to make some of the most common changes.

#### Gather feedback and refine again

Now that you have built a rough version of your tool, get it in the hands of real users.
You should consider two kinds of users:

* Subject matter experts, and
* Users that are relatively close to the profile of your real user.

Ideally, set up a time to walk through the app together with both kinds of users. You can
run through the app over Zoom. Get feedback from at least 3 to 5 users.

Follow the guidance on [running a usability 
test](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/testing/testing#usability-tests)
to get the most out of the feedback sessions.

#### Create a wishlist of improvements

Getting feedback can be like drinking from a firehose. Some of it will be easy
to act on. Some will contradict feedback from other users. Some will be plain wrong.

Do your best to sort through the feedback and come up with a prioritized list of future
changes. Implement the top priority ones, and be ready to save the rest for a future
person to pick up some day! You won't be able to implement all of the ideas within the 
time you have to complete this project.
