### Class discussion (30 minutes)

Reading: Law Firms are Inefficiency Factories. https://perma.cc/3S2F-R3Q3

Key points:

* The buyer may not be consciously buying inefficiency from the seller, but that
  is exactly what is happening. And the buyer will be paying for it whether they
  want to or not.

* It's as if every time you went to a restaurant for a nice meal and paid $100,
  you found that the "service charge" is half the total bill, i.e. $50 is for
  the culinary skills and ingredients, $50 for getting it onto your plate.

* It's hard to quantify, but even being conservative, we'd have to guess that
  law firm incomes would be down about half what they are today if they couldn't
  sell their inefficiency to anyone.

Discussion topics:

* What is the author's main point?
    * Clients want to buy a result, not your time.
    * Law firms make bigger profits by doing things the hard way.
    * Law firms are particularly inefficient compared to other businesses.
    * If law firms become more efficient, they will lose money.
    * Automation is one way law firms can become more efficient.

* What do you think of the author's main point? How different is a 
  law firm from a restaurant?
    * How much overhead comes with a restaurant meal?

* Can you think of a better metaphor than "inefficiency factory"?

* Do you agree that automation will cost law firms money?
    * How much room is there for law firms to expand business?

* Why do people outsource things anyway?
    * inability to deliver the thing
    * lack of time to do it
    * someone else can do it more cheaply and efficiently

* Do people hire lawyers for the same reasons that they hire a painter or go to a restaurant?

* How has automation shaped the rest of society?
    * Stratification of society?
    * Haves/have nots?
