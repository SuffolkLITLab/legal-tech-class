## Week 5 9/28: Hello, World in Docassemble

Please make sure to allocate plenty of time before class to complete the exercises!

* Try it at least a few days in advance
* Ask for help on Slack when you get stuck (follow the "30 minute" rule). Keep
  in mind I will be more available to help 9-5, during the week.

**Before class**:

[Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) is the foundation for Community.Lawyer,
and allows much more advanced automations. It is also completely free and
customizable, but takes more time and experience to develop in and to host.

Make sure you have an account on the Suffolk LIT Lab Docassemble server,
https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org. NOTE: this server is for Suffolk Law
Students, only.

Follow-along with the training from this year's Docacon below. **You only need
to listen until about 1:45**, which covers the Hello, World exercise and the
logic section. You can skip the Docx example which takes place in the second
half of the training.

The video includes breaks, questions, and introduction which you do not need to
watch. Feel free to watch at a higher speed as well.

Also see the training materials, which are hosted as part of this [legal tech
text book](classes/docacon-2020/hello-world.md).

We will meet for a shorter period, 60 minutes, this week to answer your questions about
the Hello, World exercise.

After class: do the stretch goals for both the [Hello,
World](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/classes/docacon-2020/hello-world#your-assignment)
and the
[Logic](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/classes/docacon-2020/logic#your-assignment)
sections of the training.

Turn in a hello_world.yml and logic.yml file via [the Microsoft
Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=qT9zeA5UuE6_KXPE7rY0EvfCmbvxns1Fu0wRF1ZKxuFURUJIQ1NYUFNXM1pMWlhIS0hTOVRCUzJaQy4u&sharetoken=O1ZBtGGZvuhPGE84Bhse).

## Week 6 10/5: Docassemble continued -- more questions and practice ~Introduction to Microsoft Forms and Power Automate; Discussion about billing, accounting, and business aspects of running a law firm~

We will spend this week practicing some of the docassemble skills from week 5.

## Week 7 10/13: Building Your Own Chatbot

**Monday schedule, class meets at regular time on Tuesday**

Go to [qnamarkup.org](https://qnamarkup.org).  Read the syntax and watch the

Take 20 min to review the [Syntax page](https://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/) and
work through a few of the examples found in the [Quick Start
Guide](https://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/QnA_Quick_Start.pdf).

## Week 8 10/19: Free Tool Fiesta

In groups of 2 (or 3 if necessary) students will demonstrate a FREE tool they
have identified that would be useful to small firms/solos.  Be able to show off
how it works and answer questions about its features and the costs associated
with it. [Sign up

## Week 9 10/26: Community Lawyer, Advanced Skills

For many students, using Community.lawyer will make sense for their final
project.  To prepare for this meeting, spend some time looking at
[Community.lawyer's documentation](https://community.lawyer/help-guide) for a sense of what questions you might have
about how to build conditional logic into your app.

You should feel to reach out to the Community.lawyer team directly (there are buttons to schedule a call with Community.lawyer all over their website). They are available to help you think through how to structure your automation.
