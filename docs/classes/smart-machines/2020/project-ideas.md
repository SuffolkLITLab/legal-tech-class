## Potential Project ideas

Please see the brief descriptions of potential projects below. If you are
interested, I can play matchmaker and obtain more information about any of them.

### Housing search log
One problem that tenants face is obtaining subsidized housing. Often they apply
to many waiting lists. When you are homeless, waiting to get housed, it's
difficult to keep track of the places you apply. However, every year each place
you apply will require you to send them a letter confirming that you want to
stay on the waitlist. This letter often gets lost and tenants have to reapply.

Potential partners: [Homestart](https://www.homestart.org) or [Rosie's
Place](https://www.rosiesplace.org)

### Intake for HomeStart

[Homestart](https://www.homestart.org) is looking for a partner that might help
them produce a useful online screening intake to help people who need assistance
paying their rent.

### Screener for immigrants at risk of deportation

The [Asian Outreach Project](https://www.gbls.org/our-work/asian-outreach) at
Greater Boston Legal Services would like to create a tool to help immigrants who
are facing deportation. While their focus is on the Southeast Asian community in
Greater Boston, the tool will work state-wide and could be the basis for a
national project. There is a point person who is interested in technology and
this is a project that would have active engagement from the partner guaranteed.
(A good way to measure success!)

The phase 1 that I would expect 2-3 students to work on would be a triage tool
to help AOP identify cases that need immediate representation. It would include:

* Gathering immigration history
* Gathering information about upcoming court or immigration proceedings
* Fill-in a blank CORI (criminal record information) request for the person to
  mail in

Future phases could have a much more detailed questionnaire that would help with
risk assessment and managing the life of a case to gather documents from many
different sources, including FOIA requests to DOJ to get immigration
proceedings. Part of your work would be identifying a realistic scope for a
phase 1 and a plan for future phases.

### Annotated Index Generator for Harvard Immigration and Refugee Program at GBLS

This project has some working code already. You'd be evaluated on the new work.
The project would help asylum lawyers prepare the massive "annotated indices"
that support an asylum claim. Specifically, it would focus on gathering "country
conditions' which mix different attributes of an asylum seeker (e.g., gang
violence or ethnicity) with a time period and country.

### Guided interview for School to Prison Pipeline

The [School to Prison Pipeline
project](https://www.gbls.org/our-work/elder-health-disability/school-to-prison-pipeline-intervention-project)
focuses on school discipline. There are very few staff. They would like to
create some guided interviews to help students on their own.

### How to e-file : user friendly guide

E-filing is a new and potentially exciting opportunity for low-income and pro se
litigants in Massachusetts. It can make it easier for people who can't leave
work or can't pay for the T fare to get to court on time. However, there is a
big learning curve. Creating a video and guided interview to guide litigants
could be very helpful. There is likely some information from Tyler (the e-filing
vendor) to look at first--I am not sure how comprehensive or high quality it is.

### How much do you qualify for in TAFDC

It is enormously complicated to understand both whether you qualify for welfare
benefits (TAFDC) and how much you qualify for. You could work on this project
with an attorney at GBLS or [MLRI](https://www.mlri.org), or any legal aid
program.

Note: this project may already have been worked on by students in a different
Suffolk class, so may not be a good one to re-do. But if you're interested, we
can see where that project could be extended or falls down.

### Legal Resource Finder triage tool screeners/advice tools

Community Legal Aid recently received a Technology Initiative Grant from the
    Legal Services Corporation to improve the [Legal Resource
    Finder](https://www.masslegalservices.org/FindLegalAid). As part of this
    grant, they would like to create 5 short screeners to address different
    housing topics. For example: *
    https://a2j.documate.org/interview?i=docassemble.playground81%3AHousing+v3+Multiple+Issues.yml#page1
    (this is very rough but gives you an idea of what they want)

Topics would include:
* I am behind in my rent
* I have bad conditions that need to be fixed
* I live in public/subsidized housing and my rent is incorrect
* I am facing eviction

You would work with Community Legal Aid (Springfield) and Mass Law Reform
Institute on this project. They are very interested in having volunteers. This
would be a good team project and will definitely live on.

Depending on number of students, I'd recommend including some form documents as
well as the triage/advice piece of this project.

### Guide someone on using the right leave policy

Helping people figure out the best leave to use when they need to take time off
from work for personal or family needs. You would work with
[MLRI](https://www.mlri.org) on this project.

Here's a start at a flow chart:

* You have an illness or need to see a doctor, go to:
    * Earned sick
    * FMLA
* A family member has an illness or needs to see a doctor, go to:
    * Earned sick
    * FMLA
    * Small necessities
* You are (or your spouse is) about to give birth or adopt a child, go to:
    * Parental
* You or a family member need to address a domestic violence problem, go to:
    * Earned sick
    * DV
* A family member is being called up to active military duty, go to:
    * FMLA
* You need to vote, go to::
    * Wage/hour
* You have jury duty, go to:
    * Wage/hour

## Other ideas

One classic law school tech project is taking a small legal issue and helping a
client understand if it applies to them. Think of a novel issue or one that many
consumers might face with clear (not ambiguous) but relatively complex rules.
For example:

* Can I change my name?
* Do I qualify for a benefit?
* Should I use the income-based repayment plan for my student loans?
