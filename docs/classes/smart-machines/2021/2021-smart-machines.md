## About the class

The practice of law is increasingly built around digital tools. Lawyers who
understand technology have an advantage in the marketplace, both to reduce their
operating costs and to help more people. Lawyers today use technology to:

* Run the business side of the law firm, including
    * Tracking client information
    * Reaching new clients
* Help make decisions
* Reduce repetitive tasks through automation and templates
* Deliver legal services directly to litigants

This class will provide you a survey of the world of legal technology, with
special attention to the use of technology to serve underserved markets and to
address the access to justice gap.  In the second half of the class, you will
produce a final project using one of the tools that we learned in class to solve
a legal problem.

We will have a variety of guest speakers in this class, representing the public
interest, corporate, and academic perspectives on legal technology. Guest names
and bios will be provided in advance.
No programming experience or other technical background is required.

## Textbook/Course Materials

All readings and course materials will be available online. You may choose to
download and print various articles. You will be expected to sign up for free
accounts on publically hosted websites, while other accounts will be provided
for you. Students are expected to bring an Internet-connected laptop with a
modern web browser to each class session.

Consider a second monitor, which will cost less than any of your required
textbooks. This will allow you to watch a screenshare while following along on
your own computer. I recognize most students will not have this, and I do not
expect anyone to buy one if it does not feel affordable. Please let me know when
you need me to slow down so you can switch back and forth between the two views.

## Software tools
We may make use of some of the following free websites and software applications:

*	GitHub (https://github.com) 
*   Trello (https://trello.com)
*	Teams (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/) 
*	Docassemble (https://docassemble.org) (Instructor will provide server information)
*	QnAMarkup (https://qnamarkup.org) 
*	Documate (https://documate.org)

Required software will not need to be installed on your computer. You can use a Windows, Macintosh or Linux computer for all course assignments.
