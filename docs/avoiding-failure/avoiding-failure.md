Something that I emphasize at the beginning of every class is the importance of
cultivating what experts call a "growth mindset". Having a growth mindset means:

1. Recognizing that computer programming is a learnable, practiceable skill.
1. Understanding that [there is no "coding
   gene."](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/179347-anyone-can-learn-programming-teaching-genetics/fulltext),
   [perma.cc](https://perma.cc/D5PF-FFKY). Comfort, practice, and interest make
   up the bulk of being a good programmer.
1. Allowing yourself to be comfortable failing repeatedly and recognizing that
   failure is part of the learning process.
1. Treating yourself kindly.

## Software development gives you multiple chances

Lawyers and law students often find that they have to redefine the meaning of
being a successful learner when they tackle coding the first time. In many law
school classes, you get a single high stakes test at the end of the semester. As
a litigator, you may also have a single opportunity to make your case.

## Errors are normal in software development

Software development is not like that. The process of computer programming often
involves repeatedly running into errors. Errors are an opportunity to learn. In
addition, [creating a successful product requires
iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping). The first draft
is often the first chance to do real discovery about what works and what does
not work.

## Fluency comes with practice; Memorizing is harmful

Law students, especially coming out of the first year, get used to a Socratic
method of instruction. Students are given written decisions and expected to
synthesize and puzzle out rules. Being called on unexpectedly is a chance to
shine or to be embarassed in front of a hundred peers. Questions in class are
given cryptic responses. As a result, students learn to keep questions to
themselves, and to wait to ask or share what they learn until they are sure
that their answer is right.

In programming, in contrast, the art of looking up answers is a
[meme](https://www.google.com/search?q=stack+overflow+meme) that never dies.
Programming rewards efficiency, and re-writing a solution that already exists is
discouraged. It is not just okay, but expected to use libraries, prewritten
code, and samples to reduce reinvention of basic components of your product.
There is plenty of room to demonstrate your individual learning while using 
the available resources to:

1. Look up model answers to similar problems;
1. Try and fail and try and fail until something works;
1. Ask for help when you are stuck, even if you think the problem is
   embarassingly simple. 


Software development is a creative endeavor that can be truly exhilarating.
There is the struggle of creation and then the excitement and joy of producing
something that can live on in the world. Most of all, it should be fun.
