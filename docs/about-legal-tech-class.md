The aim of this living "textbook" is to help you, the student, to learn the
fundamentals of legal technology. You may read this "book" completely on your
own or with a professor in a formal setting.

This is meant to be a collection of material covering the very wide and diverse
topic of legal technology. As such, any given class may zero in on a small
subset of the material. For the most part, the materials are aimed at "doers",
but there are plenty of links and materials aimed at thinking about legal
technology.

You can use this material to to learn how to become a developer in an open
source expert system called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org), as well as
view links to materials for learning other platforms, including [A2J
Author](https://a2jauthor.org), [QnA Markup](https://qnamarkup.org), and
[HotDocs](https://hotdocs.com).

There are plenty of practical tips for becoming an effective developer of expert
systems and document automation platforms: from design thinking to project
management and using plain language.

You can also learn about the theory and principles that we feel every legal
technologist should know. For example:

* What is the [access to justice problem](a2j/a2j.md), and how can technology help address it?
* How do existing legal service delivery models serve users of the legal system?
* How does law regulating lawyers address legal technology?
* How can technology be a tool for perpetuating and exacerbating existing
  injustices?
* What special risks come with legal technology that aren't present in
  one-to-one representation?

By the end of a class or a self-guided learning session using the materials
here, you should be a confident legal technologist. You will have a sense of
where to go next in your learning journey. Legal technology is an exciting
field; an area that changes constantly in a legal industry that is otherwise
built so much on the past.

almost all of the content as of 2020, so the material reflects his interests and
biases. However, he hopes to encourage collaboration from many sources, and the
material will start to become a centralized library reflecting many overlapping
goals. Several people have contributed thoughts and ideas on [this Trello
