## Why test?

The word "testing" can encompass many overlapping goals, including:

* Discovery - learning what product to create, and what features it should have
* Identifying usability problems in your tool
* Verifying the correctness of your tool

## Forms of testing

### Focus groups

A focus group typically includes:

- A moderator
- A group of 3-5 representative potential users of the product you intend to
  build
- A series of questions designed to learn what the users value and desire, and
  their particular needs
- A session that can be between 1 and 2 hours long

Focus groups are most effective early in your product design process, before you
have actual wireframes or code that they can interact with. Once you have a real
product, one on one usability tests may be more effective.

Before holding a focus group, come up with a few key goals that you hope it will
achieve. Then, think of 10-20 questions, with follow-ups, that help explore your
big themes.

You should expect to pay focus group participants. Typical honorariums range
from $25 to $200.

It's a good idea to record your focus group sessions, but you should also take
notes. If you have multiple observers, have each observer write down 3 key
takeaways. After the focus group session is complete, compare notes and discuss
the main points you can use to drive your product's direction.

Without focus groups, it can be hard to know if the product that you are
planning to build will actually meet the needs of your users. But it's important
to remember: you are asking your users to guess what they want, but they may not
be able to accurately state what that is.

### Usability tests

Usability tests also involve talking about your product with real users. They
are not the same as focus groups. Usability tests:

- Involve a single user at a time
- Require a series of tasks that you will observe the user attempt, not
  questions for them to answer
- Involve a moderator who will be in the "room" (camera on) with the user
- Should have multiple observers who can be camera off, and will be looking for
  the key usability problems that the test surfaces

Usability tests are critical to producing a product that your user can actually
use without difficulty. If you don't have an actual product to test yet, you can
actually run usability tests on your competitor's products! You can learn a lot
about how to design your tool "right" by seeing what your competitor or
benchmark site does "wrong."

When designing a user test, your first goal is to come up with a series of
tasks. Tasks should be somewhat open-ended. Assigning an open-ended task to
guided interviews can be tricky as guided interviews tend to be linear, but you
can always start the task on the landing page. Even very simple guided
interviews do tend to involve some branching logic, however. And you can also
assign tasks such as changing an answer, downloading a form, or viewing
instructions that require the user to select among many possible menu items
visible on the screen.

For example: get a child support plan as part of your restraining order.

Start off the usability test by reassuring the user that you are testing the
product, not the user. Warm the user up with a few general questions. Ask for
their general impressions of the site, and then move into observing the user
attempting your tasks.

This script from [the US government agency
18F](https://methods.18f.gov/usability-test-script/) is a great place to start.

Some other key things to remember during the usability test:

- Have your user narrate what they are thinking out loud.
- While observing your user, be careful not to offer help. You can answer
  questions at the end.

Below is a video demonstrating a model usability test from start to finish:

It's a good idea to record your usability tests, but you should also take notes.
If you have multiple observers, have each observer write down 3 key takeaways.
After the usability session is complete, compare notes and discuss the highest
priority usability issues that you can fix.

Keep usability tests simple so that you can conduct them regularly. A good
cadence is once a month.
