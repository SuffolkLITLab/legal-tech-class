you have identified before next week.

## Week 9 3/24: Free Tool Fiesta

In groups of 2 (or 3 if necessary) students will demonstrate a FREE tool they
have identified that would be useful to small firms/solos.  Be able to show off
how it works and answer questions about its features and the costs associated
with it.

If you have trouble finding a completely free tool, a very low cost tool or tool with
a free trial would also be fine.

You may find the following websites a good resource for identifying free tools,
but please expand your search!
