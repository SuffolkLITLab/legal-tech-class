## Meeting Time
LAW-2156-AD

Tuesday 02:00PM - 03:50PM, Sargent Hall, Room 245

We will also have several remote classes via Zoom.

## Course overview

Becoming familiar with legal technology as a consumer, author, 
or project manager is a competitive advantage in today's legal market. 
Lawyers today use technology to:

* Run the business side of the law firm, including
    * Tracking client information
    * Reaching new clients
* Help make decisions
* Reduce repetitive tasks through automation and templates
* Deliver legal services directly to consumers

Lawyering in the Age of Smart Machines is a survey-style seminar that
aims to introduce you to the use of legal technology in the practice of law. We
will focus closely on the access to justice problem and the needs of people
who cannot afford to hire attorneys.

50% of your grade will be based on a final project that incorporates legal technology.
Most students will create a simple "app" that solves a legal problem using the tools and processes
of the [Document Assembly Line](https://github.com/suffolklitlab/docassemble-AssemblyLine). You
may also choose a different technology to develop your final project.
**You do not need any prior coding background or experience** to earn an "A" in this class.

About half of our in-class time will be spent on discussions and exercises that get you
thinking about legal technology, and about half will be hands-on training with a representative
sample of legal technology tools. We will spend special attention to the free and open source
[Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) application.

We will have frequent guest speakers and readings that address different aspects of legal
technology and law.

### Course materials

There are no required textbooks for this class. All readings will be available online for free.

### Course Goals & Learning Objectives

GOALS |	OBJECTIVES |	ASSESSMENTS
------|------------|------------------
Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to know/understand:	| Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:	| How the student will be assessed on these learning objectives:
Students will know what technologies are being used by lawyers and others to assist with distinctly legal work, and understand the possibilities and fit of different legal technologies	| Identify different kinds of legal technology, and compare the benefits and disadvantages of different tools for differerent scenarios | In-class discussion, presentations
What ethical and regulatory issues are presented by legal technology | Describe the current regulatory landscape and challenges posed by ethical rules for additional legal technology, as well as the potential moral considerations in both additional automation and potentially failure to automate routine work |	In-class discussion
Know how to break down a process analytically into component parts |	Map a process and identify inefficiencies and potential improvements	|Demonstrated through project work

What career paths are available for technologically savvy lawyers |	Describe the many roles of technology in the legal practice and how technical knowledge can assist in different job functions	|In-class discussion

### Grading

Your final grade will be based on the following scores:

Component                 | Percent
--------------------------|----------------------
Legal tech assessment     | 10% (opportunity for extra credit)
Weekly journal entries    | 10% (pass/fail)
Plain language exercise   | 5%
Peer review               | 5%
"Free tool fiesta"        | 10% (potential group project)
App "teardown"            | 10%
Final project outline     | 10%
Final project             | 40% (potential group project)

My goal is to give you a chance to demonstrate your mastery of the
material in multiple ways over the course of the semester and to avoid
a single high stakes assessment. You will have an opportunity for frequent
feedback and advice on your final project.

Class works best when everyone is an active participant.
However, research shows that using class participation as the basis for grading
is often [arbitrary and unfair](https://www.edutopia.org/article/class-participation-too-arbitrary-grade-fairly).
Therefore, class participation will not factor into your final grade.

### Philosophy

The philosophy of this course is that by becoming familiar with legal technology
and using it to solve real problems, you will be able to become a better
critic, regulator, purchaser, and consumer of legal products as a practicing attorney. I do
not expect you to become expert software developers. You should learn "just enough"
to be useful in your future work.

I will do my best to provide you opportunities for growth in this class, and I expect
you to come into the class with a "growth mindset".

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1CHPnZfFmU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The process of computer programming often
involves repeatedly running into errors. Errors are an opportunity to learn. In
addition, creating a successful product requires iteration. The first draft is
often the first chance to do real discovery about what works and what does not
work.

As new coders, you will need to ask a lot of questions. I will never "hide the
ball" or refuse to answer direct questions. Questions are part of the learning
process, especially for new coders. Failing to ask questions may frustrate and
slow you down.

:::info Rule of thumb
If you are stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, ask for help! Use Teams,
ask a friend, or send me an email. Chances are there will be a more interesting
problem to solve after we get past your "blocker".
:::

Software development is a highly results-oriented domain. It is not just okay,
but expected to use libraries, prewritten code, and samples to reduce
reinvention of basic components of your product. I expect each student to
produce unique work, but not to waste time rewriting code that already works to
achieve a goal.

Being successful in this class means:

* Asking for help and feedback early. You will not be graded negatively if you
  don't understand everything right away. It's expected to need to ask many
  questions early on.
* Accepting that you will run into errors and perhaps dead ends
* Your first draft will look very different from your final product
* It is not just okay, but an important part of the process to collaborate,
  share early drafts, and gather feedback.

Software development is a creative endeavor that can be truly exhilarating.
There is the struggle of creation and then the excitement and joy of producing
something that can live on in the world. Most of all, it should be fun.

#### Class 13: April 26 **Final project presentations**

## Final project

Your final project should likely be a relatively simple, self-contained legal app that 
either does:

* document assembly
* or triage and advice.

An excellent project will have 10-20 screens and complete a 1-2 page form. I expect you to
spend about 40 hours on your final project, including research, testing, and planning.

Many students will choose to work on a simple court form, application, or intake tool that can use
the LIT 
Lab's [Document Assembly Line project](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/), 
framework that we will spend time with in class. 
This framework will give you a lot of autonomy to find something related to a legal problem that is
of special interest to you. If you prefer to use a different tool, please feel free to come to me with an idea for an app
that does not fall within the parameters above.

### May 13 **Final project due at 5 PM**

### Grading rubric

The initial project outline is due separately (in week 7) and will be 10% of your final
grade.

Category | Summary | Due date| Percent of final project grade 
---------|---------|---------|-------------
Research | Document the work done to understand the form's purpose and meaning | Graded at end | 15%
Final presentation | Present your work in progress | Week 13 | 10%
Completeness | How well does the project solve the problem? | Graded at end | 25%
Polish and refinement | How refined is the user experience, including use of language, input types, and question order? | Graded at end | 25%
Iteration and use of feedback | How well did the student solicit and incorporate feedback | Graded at end | 10%
Final project description | How well did the student document the process of development? | Graded at end | 10%
Preparing for handoff | How well did the student document the next steps to continue refining the project? | Graded at end | 5%

#### Research

Use your research skills to identify the relevant statutes, rules, and context
that your user would need to navigate your app.

Document the location and sources that supports your work.

#### Initial outline

A legal app is an **intervention** at a single point in a client's journey.
To be effective, it should address the client's needs **before** selecting
the app, **during** the time they use it, and **after** they walk away.

Your intial outline should answer all of the questions below, either 
written out in order or in a narrative form, if you prefer. Most students will
have an outline that is 3-4 pages, including draft questions.

In some cases you will not yet have enough information to answer each question fully.
Identify sources that you can use to fill in the missing details. Do your best to be
complete.

Before beginning, review your final project's output document.
Put yourself in the position of an attorney sitting across the table from
your client and filling in the form or providing advice.

1. Who is your client? What goal do they have?
1. At what stage of their legal problem are you intervening?   
1. What information do you need to complete the form or provide advice? Write a list.
1. What would your client need to know **before** they meet with you? What
   documents might they bring? What might they need to look up in a third-party
   source?
1. What questions would you want to ask? Try writing a draft of the questions.
1. What information and context would your client need? Write down an outline of
   the information your user would need.

Next, think about what your client will need to know when they walk away from
your app. In your outline, start a draft of instructions that you might give someone
when they download and print or e-file your form.

If you are not sure yet, identify sources that you can use to fill in the missing details.
Do your best to be complete.

1. What steps does your client need to take after they meet with you?
1. What real-world actions might happen in response to your advice or filing the form?
1. When and how will the client receive a result from the form or advice?

#### Final presentation

You will be asked to present your work to the class during our last class
session. This does not need to be a completed project. You will still have 2
weeks to finish your work. Your final presentation should be about 5 minutes,
and include:

1. A description of the problem you were trying to solve.
1. A walkthrough of your ideation and research phases.
1. A demonstration of your proposed solution. (screenshots or diagrams are OK)
1. A discussion of your project's impact, and if applicable, testing.

You are welcome but not required to incorporate slides and a live demo. It's
okay if you only demo a few screens. Errors are to be expected but your final
product that you turn in should run through to the end.

#### Completeness, polish and refinement

Focus on:

1. Logically ordered and constructed questions.
1. Use of appropriate inputs (e.g., area fields, radio buttons), at least
   noting where you wanted to use a different input but were stuck.
1. Grouping fields together logically and making thoughtful choices about the
   length of screens.
1. Use of clear, readable language.
1. Provision of helpful information and context to your user.
1. Creation of an appropriate set of "next steps" instructions for your user to
   take with them after they finish using your app.

Most of these steps can be documented in a Word document or in a series of
wireframe mock-ups even if you run into issues with code. Focus on the
substance, not the code, and ask for help when you are stuck.

#### Iteration and incorporation of feedback

1. Send a prototype of your app, or app outline, to an expert early to get
   advice and feedback. (If an expert is available).
1. Send out your app for feedback from members representing your potential
   clients. These can be friends, family, or peers.

Most forms should have experts available, either inside the university or
the Court Forms Online volunteer project. If there is no expert for your 
form, it may not be the right form for you.

You should document all feedback but not all feedback will be actionable. 
Be thoughtful about what feedback you decide to implement and which you 
decide against. You may also have feedback that is a good idea but is too
advanced to reach in the context of this class. Write that down, too.

Documenting feedback is not all you should do: use the feedback to 
revise, improve, and extend your app's capabilities. You may choose
to document this process with screenshots along the way, or with the 
GitHub commit log.

A model app will have at least 3-4 revisions and feedback from 3-4 individuals,
although not each revision will get its own round of feedback.

#### Final project description

Your final project description is my best way to know how you did with 
each of the separate graded components above.

Describe your work process, the form itself, and reflect on how well you
achieved each of the gradeable components of the project.

A model project description will be at least 2 pages, but may extend longer
especially if it includes excerpts from user feedback or next steps.

#### Preparing for handoff

Code-based projects, however, can always be extended, improved, and refined. If
you chose a form on the Court Forms Online Assembly Line, your form may be
picked up by a student in the next months or years. Even if you did not, part of
your grade includes:

1. Identifying work that you did not complete but that would meaningfully
   improve the form.
1. Identifying feedack from an expert that you ran out of time to implement or
   that was outside of the scope.

If possible, your next-step action items should be recorded as issues in GitHub.
If you are not using GitHub for your project, you can include the action items
in a more detailed way in your final project description.
