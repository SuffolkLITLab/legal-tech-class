## Something from Nothing: Assembling Your First Documents with Docassemble

We have already explored ways to show text to the user, from our very first
[Hello, World exercise](classes/2020-law-smart-machines-assignment-1.md).

We can create documents using the same method. We need to learn about a new `specifier` first:
the `attachment` specifier. You can read more about `attachments` here, or check out the [official documentation](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#oview).

## Example

Let's demonstrate a simple interview that assembles a Hello, World document.
We'll use a few new specifiers: the `attachment` specifier, and a few options that fall underneath it to control the name and content of the document we create.

```yaml

  As a best practice, let's continue to use an object whenever we collect information about a person. Check out Assignment 2 if you need to refresh your memory.
objects:
  - client: Individual
--- 
comment: |
  This block controls the order of questions in the interview
mandatory: True
code: |
  client.name.first
  download_files
---
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - First: client.name.first
  - Last: client.name.last  
---
comment: |
  As a reminder, an event specifier is used for an ending screen.
event: download_files
question: |
  Your file is ready
attachment:
  name: Hello World
  filename: Hello_World
  content: |
    Hello, ${client}
```

Let's take a closer look our sample interview. As a reminder, instead of a standard variable name, we're using an [Individual object](practical-guide-docassemble/object-oriented-programming.md#the-individual-class) to store the information about our user. We use the `objects` block to create our `client` object.

The only new feature of our interview comes in the `attachment` specifier at the end. Notice we have three options indented below the `attachment` specifier:

1. `name`: A descriptive name that is shown by Docassemble on the screen
1. `filename`: The filename that the user will download (we don't need to include .pdf or .rtf)
1. `content`: the actual text that the document will contain, which can include Mako + Markdown. If we click the "preview" link, we can see a preview of the attachment.

Here's how those options will appear on the screen:

<img alt="Attachment example" src={useBaseUrl('img/Hello_world_document.png')} />

Docassemble also offers us an option to email the completed document.

## Putting it into practice

[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/) uses international letter writing and other pressure campaigns
to get governments around the world to release "[prisoners of conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_conscience)". Let's write a tool that might help someone write letters more efficiently.

Our letter will request the release of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Birmingham jail.

In addition to the `attachment` specifier, we introduce two new kinds of screens:

* The [`area` input type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#plaintext)
* An [information screen with a continue button](https://docassemble.org/docs/questions.html#tocAnchor-1-6-3), which uses the specifier `field`
* A [signature screen](https://docassemble.org/docs/questions.html#tocAnchor-1-6-5), which uses the specifier `signature`

Let's start with some working code. We'll modify this to improve it.

```yaml
---
objects:
  - user: Individual
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  introduction
  user.name.first
  custom_paragraph
  user.signature
  download_screen
---
comment: |
  Using an introduction screen is a good idea. It helps your
  user understand what the tool can and cannot do.

  Use the specifier field for a screen that doesn't do anything
  except display a continue button.

  This tool will help you send a letter to request the release of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He was arrested in August 1963 during non-violent demonstrations against segregation in the city of Birmingham, Alabama.

  At the end, we'll ask you sign the letter, print it, and mail it to the city prosecutor's office.

    ## The charges against Martin Luther King Jr. must be dropped

    Dear Prosecutor,

    I am writing to you concerning the prosecution of Martin Luther King Jr., who is currently incarcerated in the Birmingham Jail.

    Dr. King was arrested as a non-violent participant in protests against segregation. His arrest is unfair and in violation of international law.

    ${custom_paragraph}

    In conclusion, I ask you to immediately release Dr. King.

    Yours sincerely,

    ${user.signature}

    ${user}
```

## Assignment

* Change the file name of the letter to be more descriptive
* Add a yes/no question to the interview that prompts the user about whether they live in Alabama. Look back at assignment 3 for one way to add a [yes/no question](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#fields%20yesnoradio) using the `fields` specifier. You could also use [yes/no buttons](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#yesornoquestions).
* Add an optional paragraph using `% if ...:` and `% endif` tags that only displays if they live in Alabama. For example, it might say "As an Alabama resident, I am disappointed..." You may want to review the section in [Mako](mako.md#use-conditional-text) on conditional text. We also used conditional text in Assignment 1.
