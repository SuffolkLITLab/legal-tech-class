One way to solve the access to justice gap at scale is to apply technology. Consumers around
the world have become more comfortable with using digital tools, such as apps or websites,
to solve problems on their own. Unlike one-on-one assistance, technology works all day or
night. The cost of providing digital help comes in building the tool; helping an additional
person once the tool is built costs almost nothing compared to the cost of one-on-one legal help.

Digital tools allow people with legal problems to solve problems:

1. on their own schedule
1. without needing to travel
1. for a predictable cost that is usually much lower than hiring an attorney

Just like we go to department store to buy shoes (or order online) instead of
visiting a cobbler, many legal problems simply do not need the one-on-one
attention of an attorney. Those problems that benefit from full or partial
automation can be delivered cheaply and effectively with the help of technology.

Technology focused on closing the access to justice gap includes:

* direct self-help tools, such as document assembly and expert systems, that help complete court forms or help
  someone understand their rights in context
* legal information websites or interactive tools (like games) where people can learn about the law
* interactive forums where litigants can get direct help from an attorney, such as [ABA
  Free Legal Answers](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/probono_public_service/projects_awards/free-legal-answers/) 
  website

There are also tools that:

* help lawyers do their work more efficiently or cheaply
* help laywers and clients connect, whether pro bono or paid
