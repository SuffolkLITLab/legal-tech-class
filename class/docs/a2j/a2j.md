title: The Access to Justice Problem
sidebar_label: Access to Justice
---

The United States has an access to justice crisis. The "access to justice gap" is the
name for the difference between the 14%[^1] of Americans who get help for their
legal problems in court and the vast majority, 86% of Americans, who do not.

In courts around the country (and the world), people do their best to solve
problems on their own without the help of an attorney in a legal system that is
designed to be used exclusively for and by attorneys. In some cases they fare
badly, and in other cases they do not get help for a problem at all.

This problem is not evenly distributed. In landlord-tenant cases, landlords are
represented as much as 90% of the time, for example,
with tenants only represented 10% of the time.[^2]

Not every problem needs an attorney, and not every litigant wants an attorney.
But it is challenging for people with legal problems to find solutions without
an attorney, too. Regulatory barriers, including state rules that purport to regulate
the unauthorized practice of law, can stop people with legal problems from solving
their problems in less expensive or more accessible ways.
