## Before you get started

Read the brief section about [Jinja](jinja.md).

## Working with Docx Templates

Let's take a look at a simple interview that automates a Docx template.
The interview has two parts: the [YAML](yaml.md) which contains the
interview and its logic, and a regular Microsoft Word document.

```yaml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  intro
  user_name
  download
---
question: |
  This interview shows how to create a Docx template
---
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - no label: user_name
---
event: download
question: |
  Your document is ready
subquestion: |
  ${hello_world}
---
attachment:
  docx filename: hello_world.docx
  variable name: hello_world 
```

Here is what the document looks like inside:

```
Hello, {{ user_name }}
```

In our document, we marked the variable with `{{ user_name }}`. The text 
`{{user_name}}` is replaced with the name the user gives us during the
interview.

There are different ways to add an attachment to a question. We're using the style
that embeds 

### What is a Docx Template?

A docx template is an ordinary Microsoft Word file. You don't use any special
Microsoft Word features to turn it into a template. You just type in the special
docassemble codes in the right place in your file.

### An introduction to Jinja syntax

You can use most of the same features in a Docx template that you can use
inside an ordinary Docassemble `question` block. Docx templates use a similar,
but slightly different syntax to what you use inside questions, called 
[Jinja](jinja.md).

* Variables are marked with double curly braces, like this: `{{ variable_name }}`
* `if` statements come in two varieties:
    * in-line `if` statements, like this: 
    `{% if is_female %}she{% elif is_male %}he{% else %}they{%endif %}`
    * Paragraph-level `if` statements, like this:
```
{%p if show_paragraph %}
You really like cheese!
{%p endif %}
```

You can also use `{% for ... %}` and other Python control structures.

## Benefits of Docx templates as compared to PDFs

* You can completely control the formatting
* `fields` expand to take up as much or as little space as they need
* You can build a table one row at a time, rather than having to
  include code that represents each possible cell in the table.
* You can place all formatting code and conditional text in the template,
  decluttering your interview file.  
* Helper functions and methods can make things even simpler

### Example

Docassemble uses [objects](practical-guide-docassemble/object-oriented-programming.md),
a useful way in programming to group a bunch of related fields.

As an example, a built-in object that we use again and again is the
Individual object.

```yaml
---
objects:
  - tenant: Individual
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  tenant.name.first
  tenant.address.address
  download
---
question: |
  Your name
fields:
  - First: tenant.name.first
  - Last: tenant.name.last
---
question: |
  Where do you live?
fields:
  - Street address: tenant.address.address
  - City: tenant.address.city
  - State: tenant.address.state
    choices: states_list()
  - Zip: tenant.address.zip
---
event: download
question: |
  Download your file
attachment: 
  docx filename: address_example.docx
```

Inside the Docx template, we could show the address and name like this:

```
Hello, my name is {{tenant}}.

 
Yours sincerely,

{{ tenant.address_block()}}
```

`address_block()` is a method of an Individual object that shows the person's full
address block, including their name. In a PDF, we would have had to code as many
as six different fields to show the same information.

## Using the built-in variables from the docassembly line project in your interview

Take a look at the list of variables in the [Docassembly Line Documentation](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line/blob/master/internal_object_names.md).

When you write a Docassemble interview that uses the MAVirtualCourt package,
you don't need to write your own questions that use these variables or the
attributes that come along with them.


## Further exploration

1. Add some more variables to the hello_world.docx template.
1. Experiment with showing/hiding optional text based on a `yesno` question.
